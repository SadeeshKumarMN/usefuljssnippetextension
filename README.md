# Useful Snippets Extension

A Chrome Extension with Useful JavaScript snippets for testing

Feel free to contribute to this set of snippets.

What we are looking for are short JavaScript snippets that can run from a popup menu and provide small useful aids to support testing.

And are also small enough that the provide useful examples of using JavaScript from the console or as Bookmarklets and help people learn to use JavaScript in their testing.

## Basic Install Instructions

- download the repo somewhere
- `chrome://extensions`
- add the `/extension` folder via 'load unpacked'
- use the context menu on various sites
- check the console to see the bot code and the code as a bookmarklet

## Initially:

- 20190320
    - Alan Richardson created the basic framework for the Chrome Extension.
    - Viv Richards contributed the initial JavaScript snippets.

## TODO

- add an icon
- add more snippets
