# ![extension icon](https://github.com/eviltester/usefuljssnippetextension/blob/master/extension/icon48.png) Useful Snippets Extension

A Chrome Extension with Useful JavaScript snippets for testing.

Feel free to contribute to this set of snippets.

What we are looking for are short JavaScript snippets that can run from a popup menu and provide small useful aids to support testing.

The snippets should also be small enough that they provide useful examples of using JavaScript from the console or as Bookmarklets and help people learn to use JavaScript in their testing.

## Basic Install Instructions

- Download and extract this repository somewhere
- Navigate to `chrome://extensions` within Chrome
- Ensure to switch 'Developer mode' on (a toggle at the top right of the page)
- Select 'Load unpacked' and then navigate to the  `/extension` folder
- Navigate to a website and then right click it to access the `Useful Snippets` context menu
- After executing a snippet you can see the bot code and get the code as a bookmarklet by viewing the DevTools console
